Each subsection below contains release notes for a specific 3W dataset version. Differences from the immediately previous version are highlighted.

## 1.0.0

Release: July 1, 2019.

This was the first published version, which is fully described in [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106223) paper.

## 1.1.0

Release: December 30, 2022.

Highlights:

1. New instances have been added as follows:
    * 1 instance of event type 7.
1. Instances have been removed due to issues identified as follows:
	* 3 instances of event type 0;
	* 1 instance of event type 5;
	* 3 instances of event type 8, when compared to what is described in the paper **A realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells** published in the **Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering** (link [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106223)).
1. Normal periods of certain instances with anomalies have been increased as possible. We tried to have instances with minimum normal periods of 1 hour;
1. Names of certain files with instances have changed due to increased normal periods;
1. Periods of certain instances have been relabeled;
1. Time series of certain variables were added because these variables were contextualized after the previous version of the 3W dataset was created;
1. Time series of certain variables were removed because these variables were decontextualized after the previous version of the 3W dataset was created;
1. Time series of certain variables have been completely changed due to these variables having been recontextualized after the creation of the previous version of the 3W dataset;
1. Certain variable values ​​have undergone minimal change due to different rounding;
1. The 3W dataset's main configuration file ([dataset.ini](dataset.ini)) has been updated;
1. The Jupyter Notebook with the [3W dataset's baseline general presentation](../overviews/_baseline/main.ipynb) has been updated.
